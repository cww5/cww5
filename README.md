### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This has most of the projects I've worked on during my time at university (undergrad and grad school), as well as personal projects. Though I try to code when I can during my free time, often other priorities in life prevent me from updating here too much such as family, friends, hobbies, health, etc. Most of the coding I do nowadays is during my day job where I commit almost daily, but because it's private to my company's domain, I can't share that work with you. Please do take a look at some of my favorite repos below!
